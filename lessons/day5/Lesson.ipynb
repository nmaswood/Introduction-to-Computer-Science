    "People have wanted secure communications for a very long time. When Caesar was conquering the world and busy on his expeditions he used a very primitive form of communication to speak with Generals. He used the __Caeser Cipher__.\n",

    "The way it works is that for the message you are trying to encrpyt. You pick a number $n$ between 1 and 25 and shift each letter in your message $n$ letters forward.\n",

    "For example if I chose $n = 1$ and had the message\n",

    "What Al-Kindi discovered is a technique called frequency analysis. This technique relies on the fact that letters in a language are not distributed uniformly. For example, if I have a corpus of English text: let's say Sunday's New York Times. It is highly unlikely that $\\frac{1}{26}$ of the letters are __a__, $\\frac{1}{26}$ of the letters are b, $\\frac{1}{26}$ of the letters are c and so on .\n",

    "\n",
    "If you were to use Frequency Analysis to break a Caesar Cipher  you would try and match observed frequencies to their known frequencies in English. For example the letter __e__ is known to have a frequency of about $13\\%$ in English. If you were in the cypher to observe the letter __z__ to have a frequency of $13\\%$ you could infer that __z__ was __e__ as work backwards.\n",

    "<img src=\"assets/vig.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
