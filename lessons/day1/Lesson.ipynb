    "\n",
    "Before we step into programming specifics we are going to pause and look into what a computer is and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 What is a Computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays there are computers everywhere: the cellphone in your pocket, the smartwatch on your wrist and of course the MacBook on your table. What do these three devices have in common? What actually makes them a computer, persay? Is a calculator a computer?\n",

    "\n",
    "A real, modern day computer works through a processor. The processor has aj limited set of instructions it can perform on values such as addition, multiplication, etc. It combines these simple instructions to do arbitraryly complex tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about binary and how computers store and process information later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 What is a Computer Program ?\n",

    "__A computer program a series of an instructions that tells a computer what to do__\n",
    "\n",

A binary number is made up of elements called bits where each bit can be in one of the two possible states. Generally, we represent them with the numerals 1 and 0. We also talk about them being true and false. Electrically, the two states might be represented by high and low voltages or some form of switch turned on or off.\n",
