I as the recipient will have to reorder the letters and ensure all of them have sent. Furthermore, if some of them are missing my friend will have to notify me and I will resend them. "

    "An IP address is a set of four numbers separated by periods (such as, for example, 192.168.1.1). Just like your physical address, this number is unique, and every computer has one. Your ISP has a digital phone book, similar to a physical phonebook, called a domain name server that’s used to convert text URLs into IP addresses.\n",

    "With the IP address located, your ISP knows which server on the Internet to forward your request to, and your personal IP address is included in this request.\n",

    "The website server receives your request, and sends a copy of the web page code to your computer for your browser to display. Your web browser renders the code onto the screen.\n",
    "\n",

From there, Facebook will check your credentials against the one stored in their database and send you an authentication cookie if everything checks out.\n",
