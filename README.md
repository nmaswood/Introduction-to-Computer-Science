## Questions

* What are the exact dates?
* How can we avoid covering too much ground? ( scope creep)
* What is the age of these kids (18++?)
* Do they know how to program?
* Do they know calculus, linear algebra? (how much math can we sneak in?)
* Should we just stick to programming and save data science for later?
* Will English be a problem? ( I don't speak French or Arabic :( )
