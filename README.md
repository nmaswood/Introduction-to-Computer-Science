<h1 align="center"> A Random Walk Through Computer Science</h1>

This repo is 10 classes worth of cirriculum and exercises for an intro to Computer Science class. Although the course is in Python I chosen to focus on trying to convey big ideas in Computer Science rather than Python syntax. I have opted for breadth over depth and I hope one of the topics covered sparks your interest for self study.
